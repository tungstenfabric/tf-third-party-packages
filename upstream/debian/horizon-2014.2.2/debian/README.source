horizon for Ubuntu
------------------

During the Juno/14.10 development cycle, use of xstatic packages was introduced
so that CSS, JS and other static assets did not have to be embedded in the
horizon source tree.

These have been packaged in Debian, however to support continued inclusion of
Horizon in Ubuntu main, and to limit the scope of use of such assets in
Ubuntu main, these assets are bundled up alongside the upstream release tarball
and are included in the python-django-horizon package under horizon.xstatic.

To refresh the orig-xstatic.tar.gz and extract it run:

    ./debian/rules refresh-xstatic

this will use pip to retrieve all xstatic assets detailed in requirements.txt
and bundle them into an additional 'upstream' tar.gz, leveraging the multi-orig
feature of source format 3.0.
