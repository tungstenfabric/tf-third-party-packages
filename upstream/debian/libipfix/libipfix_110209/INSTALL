prerequisites:
- libmysqlclient (only needed to build a collector which 
                  stores results data into a mysql database)
- libpcap (only needed to build the IPFIX probe)

To build libipfix, run "./configure" (a shell script). The configure
script will determine your system attributes and generate
appropriate makefiles from Makefile.in. Next run "make". If everything
goes well you can run "make install". 

example:
          ./configure --enable-ipv6 --prefix=/usr/local
          make
          make install

To compile the example programs:
          cd examples
          make
